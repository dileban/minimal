# Contributing to Minimal

Hello friend, thank you for taking the time! :tada:

A few pointers to help you get started..

## Style Guide

This project uses Airbnb's [JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/).

## Reporting Bugs

To report bugs, use the _Bug Report_ template when creating an issue.

Include as many details as possible to help reproduce the bug, including details of your environment (e.g. browser and operating system versions). The Bug Report template should help guide you through process.

## Feature Requests

To suggest a feature or enhancement, use the _Feature_ template when creating an issue.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are most welcome. There are no hard requirements expect adhering to existing styles used in the codebase.

Tests are recommended although the current codebase doesn't include any. This is primarily because (a) the code wasn't deemed critical enough to warrant time for writing tests (failures aren't costly) and (b) the author's limited experience in writing front-end code (this was the author's first foray into JavaScript/React/CSS). If you have experience writing tests, you are welcome to propose an approach along with suitable libraries and frameworks.

## Call for Contribution

If you are short of ideas, here are list of nice-to-haves:

**Dark Theme**

Everyone loves a dark theme! The codebase uses `styled-components` which could help with implementing a dark theme.
